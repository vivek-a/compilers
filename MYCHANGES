Part-4a

Modified starting grammer :

program:
	declaration_statement_list 	prototype_list 	function_list
;

prototype:
	variable_type NAME '(' variable_list ')' ';'
;

function_list is list of one or more functions and from then previos grammer is used.

New production "function_call" is added : 
function_call can considered as constant or a statement.

function_call:
	NAME '(' input_params_list ')'
;

In Scanner.ll :
new token VOID is added.

And all actions in parser.yy and classes in ast files are commented.
